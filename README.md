# Dc3n - Cryptocurrency Exchange Platform (Main Service)

**Dc3n** is a professional cryptocurrency exchange platform designed to handle high-frequency trading.

[Dc3n Order Matching Engine Repository](https://github.com/TerryChengTW/dc3n-order-matching-engine)

## Key Features

- **Single-Order Matching Engine**: The system integrates with a single-order matching engine, ensuring that each order is matched with only one counter-order at a time. This provides efficient and immediate order execution without batch processing.
- **Price-Time Priority**: The platform ensures fairness by enforcing the price-time priority rule. Orders are matched based on the best price, and if multiple orders have the same price, the system prioritizes the earliest submitted order.
- **Limit and Market Order Matching**: Users can submit limit and market orders, and the system will automatically match them based on market conditions.
- **Real-Time Order Book**: The system updates the order book in real time, displaying the market depth with buy and sell prices and volumes.
- **Live Market Data**: Real-time market data, including order statuses and executed trades, are pushed via WebSocket, keeping users up to date with the latest market movements.
- **Historical Trade Records**: Users can view all completed trades and access detailed transaction histories.
- **High Concurrency Support**: The platform is built on a distributed architecture that can handle high volumes of concurrent orders, ensuring stability under heavy traffic.

## Technical Stack

- **Java/Spring Boot**: The core application framework, providing REST APIs and Kafka message handling.
- **Kafka**: Manages high-concurrency order messages, ensuring reliable processing in the order they were received.
- **Redis**: Utilizes Redis's ZSet structure for managing the order book, allowing O(log N) insertion and matching of limit orders.
- **MySQL**: Persists trade data, storing all orders and transaction records for consistency and durability.
- **WebSocket**: Pushes real-time market and order updates, allowing users to track order progress instantaneously.
- **AWS EC2 & ALB**: Ensures high availability and auto-scaling capabilities through AWS EC2 and Application Load Balancer (ALB).
